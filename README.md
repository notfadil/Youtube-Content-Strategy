Contributors: Fadil Meraj

The primary problem addressed in this project revolves around optimizing content strategy and enhancing user engagement on YouTube, a platform with over 2.70 billion users​​.
Despite its vast user base, content creators often face challenges in effectively engaging their audience and growing their channels. To address this, the project aims to test several hypotheses using data available through the YouTube API: 

H1: Video Length and View Count: Whether there is a correlation between the length of videos and the number of views they receive. 

H2: Upload Frequency and Engagement: Investigating if channels that upload more frequently experience higher overall engagement. 

H3: Content-Type and Subscriber Growth: Assessing if certain types of content are more effective in driving subscriber growth. 

H4: Channel Age and View Count: Analyzing if channel age has an effect on video performance.  

By exploring these hypotheses, the project seeks to uncover actionable insights for content creators to refine their strategies on YouTube, thereby improving engagement and growth on the platform.
